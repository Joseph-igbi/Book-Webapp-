## Scope & Objectives 
The overall objective of this project is to create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training. 

This includes the following aims:
* A Trello Board with full expansion on user stories, use cases and tasks 
* A relational Database with at least 2 tables in it and a modelled relationship 
* Documentation describing the architecture that will be used and a detailed Risk Assessment 
* Functional CRUD application created in Python 
* A documented TDD approach, fully designed test suites and automated tests for validation of the application
* A functioning front-end website and integrated API's using Flask
* Code fully integrated into a Version Control System using the Feature-Branch model which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine

## Deliverables
The CRUD web app being created to meet the project scope is a Book Library application. On the app, Users can navigate through a book database containing thousands of books to find one they would be interested in reading. They will also be able to create personal shelves to which their favourite books in the app can be added or removed. 

In light of this, the minimum viable product for the app has been defined as the following- 
Users must be able to:
* Create a User account that stores:
  * *User First and Last Name*
  * *User Email
  * *User Password
* Login/Logout 
* View and update account details
* Navigate through the book database and find details on books using the search bar
* Create a personal shelf where books the user likes can be stored
* Add/Delete books from the personal shelf
* Alternatively log in as guest with the limitation of not being able to create a personal shelf

Additional functionalities to the Minimum Viable Product should include:
* View other users personal shelves
* Personal shelves could have a yearly lifetime

## Project planning
Trello, a project tracking tool, was used to both plan and track this project. The link to the trello board is in the resources above.

The project outline and parameters were outlined as part of panning in the trello board to ensure the project remains on course throughout. The Tasks and Completed columns on the trello board were used as my tracking tools.
